// This is an example of non-parameterized function since there is no parameter inside the function. 
function readString(){//header
	return "Hello World!"//body
}
console.log(readString())//This is when function is being called

/*What the program does is whenever the function is being called it will go inside that function
and returns the value/reuslt and in this case it will print Hello world since that's what we are 
returning. */
