1. The compiler tells the scope that there is an variable a.
2. Scope know that there is an variable called a 
3. Then flocoman does the tracing, and on line 1, it ask the scope if there is an variable and scope knows that there is variable a so it send the memory address of that variable to the flocoman.
4. flocoman then goes to that memeory address and gets it's RHS value;
5. flocoman then moves to next line and now it knows that there is an variable a whose RHS values is 0. 
6. Lastly it will print that values in the console.

1. The compiler tells the scope that there is a global variable f.

3. Then flocoman does the tracing, and on the line 1, it knows that it's function so flocoman gets out of the function. 
4. flocoman then moves to the last line of the code, and ask scope if you know about variable f and scope knows that there is a variable f so it send memory address of that variable to the flocoman.
5. flocoman the goes to that memory address and it finds out that it's an function.
6. flocoman then goes inside that function and lastly it will prints out whatever it returns and in this case it will print out "hello world".
